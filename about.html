## About

My name is Mati Bot and I'm a software engineer.<br>
Currently, my main focus is on mobile applications for iOS and Android. In that order.<br><br>
I started my career as a software engineer during my obligatory military service in Israel in a unit called <a href="https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2012/01/05/virtual-reality-the-idf-ground-forces-battle-lab/">Battle Lab</a>.
In Battle Lab I developed simulations of conceptual (pre prototype) weapon systems that helped measure the actual advantage of these systems in the battlefield.
In case a system shows great results in the lab testing, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) would continue to the next step by creating a prototype. In case it didn't, they had to go back to the drawing board.<br> TL;DR: I created computer games :). <br><br>
Right after my <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-do-Israelis-love-to-travel-to-India">post-miliary trip</a>, I started my BSc studies in <a href="http://www.bgu.ac.il">Ben Gurion University</a> and part-time helped my parents' tech business.
Shortly after my graduation I've decided to focus on mobile applications and joined <a href="http://www.drippler.com">Drippler</a> as a Lead iOS Developer.
It was a big challenge for me since it was the first app I released to the Appstore and Objective C looked like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qm07MUkgiA">alien language</a>.
The app tured out as a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5995398/drippler-turn-your-phone-into-the-best-damn-phone-it-can-be">huge success</a> and was downloaded by millions.<br><br>
The next company I joined was initially called Flayvr but it was changed to <a href="http://www.myroll.com">MyRoll</a>.
In MyRoll I led the development of MyRoll for iOS till we have decided to focus on the Android Platform.
In Android I led the development of the <a href="http://www.gallerydoctor.com">Gallery Doctor</a> App.
Shortly after, We returned to my platform of choice by creating Gallery Doctor for iOS.
That version was featured for 2 weeks in the Appstore and got great <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/21/10-apps-that-should-be-core-smartphone-features/">PR</a>.<br><br>
After MyRoll's acquisition by AVG Technologies, I worked in the integration between Gallery Doctor and AVG Cleaner for Android and on the rebranding of Gallery Doctor for iOS to AVG Photo Cleaner for iOS.

Recently I moved to San Francisco and started working for Punch Group as a Lead iOS Engineer.

Besides of being an iOS freak, I'm insterested in learning new languages like Japanese and Chinese, Travel the world and collect shot glasses.
