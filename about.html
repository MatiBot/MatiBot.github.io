## About

<p>Hey, I'm Mati Bot, a software engineer obsessed with mobile apps for iOS and Android, now diving deep into AI and ML integrations.</p>

<p>My career kicked off in Israel's military service at the <a href="https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2012/01/05/virtual-reality-the-idf-ground-forces-battle-lab/">Battle Lab</a>, building simulations for pre-prototype weapons. TL;DR: I made battlefield "games" to test ideas before prototyping.</p>

<p>After my post service trip in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, I grabbed a BSc from <a href="http://www.bgu.ac.il">Ben Gurion University</a> while helping my parents' tech biz. Graduated and jumped into mobile dev at <a href="https://gizmodo.com/drippler-turn-your-phone-into-the-best-damn-phone-it-c-5995398">Drippler</a> as Lead iOS Developer. That was my first App Store release. It blew up with millions of downloads and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5995398/drippler-turn-your-phone-into-the-best-damn-phone-it-can-be">great reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Next up: <a href="http://www.myroll.com">Flayvr (later MyRoll)</a>, leading iOS dev, then shifting to Android for <a href="http://www.gallerydoctor.com">Gallery Doctor</a>. We looped back to iOS, got App Store featured, and snagged killer <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/21/10-apps-that-should-be-core-smartphone-features/">PR</a>. After <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/12/avg-acquires-israeli-photo-management-startup-myroll-plans-to-integrate-the-technologies/">acquisition by AVG</a>, I integrated it into their cleaners and handled rebranding.</p>

<p>Hit San Francisco in 2016, starting at <a href="http://www.theleague.com/">The League</a> as Lead iOS/Android Engineer. Bounced through a few gigs (including <a href="http://www.close5.com/">eBay's Close5</a>) before landing at Airbnb in 2017 as a Software Engineer. Climbed to Staff, contributing to projects like adding support for <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/adding-support-for-arabic-and-hebrew-languages-on-airbnb-355f35a4e6b7">Arabic and Hebrew languages</a>, and implementing a 1-year app deprecation policy that really helped align the company around a single policy, making it clear when backend code could be removed to streamline maintenance and reduce tech debt. Then transitioned to Engineering Manager, now leading mobile innovation teams.</p>

<p>Beyond code, I'm a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">cryonicist</a>, <a href="http://astro.mati.bot">astrophotography</a> nerd, language learner (Japanese, Chinese), world traveler, and shot glass collector. In 2025, adding AI apps and sustainable tech. Can't let the robots win!</p>
