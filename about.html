## About

<p>Hey, I'm Mati Bot, a software engineer obsessed with mobile apps for iOS and Android, now diving deep into AI and ML integrations.</p>
<p>My career kicked off in Israel's military service at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130101000000/https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2012/01/05/virtual-reality-the-idf-ground-forces-battle-lab/">Battle Lab</a>, building simulations for pre-prototype weapons. TL;DR: I made battlefield "games" to test ideas before prototyping.</p>
<p>After my post service trip in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, I grabbed a BSc from <a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/">Ben Gurion University</a> while helping my parents' tech biz. Graduated and jumped into mobile dev at <a href="https://gizmodo.com/drippler-turn-your-phone-into-the-best-damn-phone-it-c-5995398">Drippler</a> as Lead iOS Developer. That was my first App Store release. It blew up with millions of downloads and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/drippler-turn-your-phone-into-the-best-damn-phone-it-c-5995398">great reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Next up: Flayvr (later MyRoll), leading iOS dev, then shifting to Android for Gallery Doctor. We looped back to iOS, got App Store featured, and snagged killer PR. After <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-avg-acquires-israeli-co-myroll-1001080757">acquisition by AVG</a>, I integrated it into their cleaners and handled rebranding.<grok-card data-id="86f408" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></p>
<p>Hit San Francisco in 2016, starting at <a href="https://www.theleague.com/home-1/">The League</a> as Lead iOS/Android Engineer. Bounced through a few gigs (including eBay's Close5) before landing at Airbnb in 2017 as a Software Engineer. Climbed to Staff, contributing to projects like adding support for <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/adding-support-for-arabic-and-hebrew-languages-on-airbnb-355f35a4e6b7">Arabic and Hebrew languages</a>, and implementing a 1-year app deprecation policy that really helped align the company around a single policy, making it clear when backend code could be removed to streamline maintenance and reduce tech debt. Then transitioned to Engineering Manager, now leading mobile innovation teams.</p>
<p>Beyond code, I'm a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">cryonicist</a>, astrophotography nerd, language learner (Japanese, Chinese), world traveler, and shot glass collector. In 2025, adding AI apps and sustainable tech. Can't let the robots win!</p>
