      <p>
        Started in Israel's military at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130101000000/https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2012/01/05/virtual-reality-the-idf-ground-forces-battle-lab/">Battle Lab</a>, building simulations for pre-prototype weapons. After serving, traveled through Southeast Asia, then earned a BSc from <a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/">Ben Gurion University</a> while helping my parents' tech business.
